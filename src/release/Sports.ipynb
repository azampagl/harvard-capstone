    "Major public events like concerts and sporting events often cause sudden spikes in demand for transportation services, both before they start and after they end. Transportation demand often increases across the system, perhaps with characteristic patterns along different lines and at specific stations. Postgame entries spike at stations in the immediate vicinity of the venue as people exit. We measure this effect in terms of “lift”—T entries in excess of those expected at a particular weekday/time around the same time of year."

    "To begin to understand these effects, we focus our analysis on Boston Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox games. Only home games were considered. Game day traffic is compared to same-weekday and -time traffic on game-less days (e.g., Sunday evening Celtics games are compared to in-season Sunday evenings). We excluded several days from both the set of game days and game-less days, including holidays and service interruptions. Our reasoning: we are seeking the effect of games on traffic, and should not consider days with unique traffic patterns that we are reasonably sure have no link to a game.\n",

    "Note that some stations service more than one line. When that happens, we allocate pregame lift to the line that services the particular team's venue. For example, Government Center lies along the Green and Blue Lines. But only the Green Line services Fenway Park and TD Garden, so all lift is allocated to those lines. This rule is applied for all analysis below."

Figure 11 shows postgame lift (from game start until several hours after end) at these stations. Typical game length roughly corresponds to the peak for each team: basketball/hockey games last (on average) just over two hours; baseball games, slightly more than three.\n",

In the former case, fans appear to immediately exit games (which we theorize to be of relatively uniform time length) and board public transportation. TD Garden holds relatively few fans, but post-game peak lift is larger than any time following a typical Red Sox game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Red Sox show a much different pattern: lift around Fenway Park gradually increases starting late in the game, and fans continue to enter the T long after the game ends. This pattern holds for individual games, suggesting that it is not an artifact of increased variance in game length; rather, many people both leave a typical baseball game early and remain in the neighborhood longer.\n",

    "Intuitively, much of the observed postgame lift is likely return traffic to the same key stations that we identify for pregame traffic. It is difficult to rigorously analyze transfers and station exits with the data that we have available. It should simply be noted that although postgame entries spike at the observed stations, ridership increases across the system (with the possible exception of the Blue Line for certain sports/games)."
