*Making Data  Matter: The Role of Information Design...*, Dominick Tribone

* **Quick summary:** Focuses on performance metrics using real-time location, expected arrivals, etc. 
May not be as applicable to us, but it's a good resource to get familiar with the MBTA.
* List of acronyms referencing statistics, organizations, data collection methods, etc
* pg 26: Table of the most pertinent statistics using vehicle tracking and fair collection data
* pg 27: Measuring the severity of service disruptions using RBT (reliability buffer time): the 
amount of extra time that passengers must budget above the typical journey time in order to arrive 
on time with a specified level of certainty --> 95th percentile minus median running time for an 
Origin-Dest pair. Can measure severity by looking at RBT for typical day compared to disrupted.
* pg 35: general background information to familiarize yourself with the MBTA and its ops.
* pg 70: Discusses the re-weighting of performance metrics using the number of expected customers.
Focuses on moving people rather than just moving trains/buses. Presents good metrics estimating
total passenger wait time using arrival rate of passengers and headway, and follows up with metrics
for branched service, like Braintree/Ashmont, and for wait times over all stations.
* pg 82: Section titled *Generating Institutional Interest in and Support for Performance Improvement*.
Talks about certain areas of the T, like the Red Line, which are known to be more problematic and have 
drawn more attention in terms of ways to improve the operations. 
* pg 113: Small paragraph the discusses the possibility for further research in estimating crowds from 
fare collection data and the methods from pages 70-72. Since we will be working primarily with aggregate
entry numbers, if we could find a way to estimate crowding and examine changes as a result of storms,
alerts, etc this could lead to insights about when/where service should be added.
